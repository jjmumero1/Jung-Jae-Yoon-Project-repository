<h2>About</h2>
Helmet Raider is a Dungeon Platformer Adventure Game about a random RPG hollow knight that lost its body from the hero's attack and is now trying to find/assemble its body together while also finding out who they are before it became a mob. I built this game to further my quest for knowledge in the field of game design.
